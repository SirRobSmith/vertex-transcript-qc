Speak up.\nCustomer:Your maximum Loan to Value for a buy-to-let property. I was looking-\nAgent:Right, the loan-to-value culmination point is typically [NUMBER] percent for portfolio landlords. Are you clear on that?\nCustomer:Culmination point? You mean the maximum LTV? So, it's [NUMBER]%? Is that for new builds as well or-\nAgent:It's [NUMBER]. Standard.

How can I help you today?\nCustomer:I have a client who has an existing residential mortgage with Atom Bank, and they're looking to do a product transfer. Their current deal expires in [NUMBER] months. Can they apply now?\nAgent:Yes, absolutely. We allow product transfer applications up to six months before the current product's expiry date. So, with [NUMBER] months remaining, they're well within the window.\nCustomer:That's great. And is the process straightforward online?\nAgent:It is. You can submit the product transfer directly through our broker portal. It's designed to be very user-friendly. You'll find all the available rates for your client there once you log in and select their existing mortgage.\nCustomer:Perfect. One more quick thing, do they need a new valuation?\nAgent:Generally, for a like-for-like product transfer with no additional borrowing, a new valuation isn't required. The system will confirm this when you proceed.\nCustomer:Excellent, that's very clear. Thank you for your help, [PERSON_NAME].\nAgent:You're most welcome, [PERSON_NAME]. Is there anything else I can assist with today?\nCustomer:No, that's all for now. Thanks again.\nAgent:Not a problem at all. Have a great day! Bye.\nCustomer:You too. Bye.",

If you would like to speak to one of our telephone business development managers regarding a new case inquiry, please press one.\nAgent:Atom Bank, [PERSON_NAME] speaking. Can I get your name and the company you're calling from?\nCustomer:Hi [PERSON_NAME], it's [PERSON_NAME] from [MORTGAGE_ADVISORS_LTD]. I've got a complex case I'd like to run by you.\nAgent:Okay, go ahead.\nCustomer:So, it's a joint application for a purchase. Applicant 1 is employed, PAYE, been in the role for [NUMBER] years. Applicant 2 is a contractor, day rate, and has only been contracting for [NUMBER] months, prior to that was PAYE in the same industry for [NUMBER] years.\nAgent:Hold on. [NUMBER] months on a day rate? What's the day rate and how many days a week is that guaranteed?\nCustomer:It's £[NUMBER] per day, and the contract is for [NUMBER] days a week, with [NUMBER] months remaining on the current contract. He has evidence of continuous employment history in the IT sector.\nAgent:Mmm, [NUMBER] months is very short. We typically look for [NUMBER] months minimum, sometimes [NUMBER]. We'd need to scrutinise the contract and the overall stability. What's the LTV they're looking at?\nCustomer:They're looking at [NUMBER]% LTV. The property is a new build flat.\nAgent:New build flat, okay. And the deposit, where's that coming from?\nCustomer:It's a combination of savings and a gifted deposit from Applicant 1's parents. The gift is [NUMBER] pounds.\nAgent:Gifted deposit is fine, standard declaration needed. With the contractor income, it's borderline due to the short history. We'd have to assess it under our manual underwriting stream, and it might affect the ICR calculations if it were a BTL, but for residential, it's more about sustainability.\nCustomer:So, you're saying it's not a definite no on the contractor income, but it would need a closer look?\nAgent:Correct. We can't give a guarantee over the phone. You'd need to submit a DIP. Also, Applicant 1, you said PAYE. Any adverse credit for either applicant?\nCustomer:No, clean credit for both. Applicant 1 also receives an annual bonus, can we use that?\nAgent:How long has the bonus been paid and what's the consistency? If it's guaranteed and paid for the last [NUMBER] years, we can potentially consider a percentage.\nCustomer:It's been paid for the last [NUMBER] years, fairly consistent amounts. Okay, so it sounds like it's worth submitting a DIP. What about the new build aspect? Any specific criteria for new build flats at [NUMBER]% LTV?\nAgent:Standard new build criteria apply. We'd need the UK Finance Disclosure Form, and the valuer will comment on marketability and suitability. Maximum LTVs on new builds can sometimes be restricted, but [NUMBER]% might be acceptable depending on the overall strength of the case, particularly the income verification for Applicant 2.\nCustomer:Right. Okay, that's a lot to take in, but I think I have a better picture. So, main hurdle is the contractor's short history.\nAgent:Essentially, yes. That's the pivotal point for our underwriters. Make sure all contract documentation is crystal clear when you submit.\nCustomer:Will do. Thanks for your time, [PERSON_NAME].\nAgent:No problem. Good luck with it.\nCustomer:Cheers, bye.\nAgent:Bye.",

The CCJ was satisfied over [NUMBER] years ago.\nAgent:Mmhmm. Well, our DIP system would probably flag that. You'd need to key it in. We don't do pre-submission reviews for credit profiles like that. LTV constraints will apply, obviously. Standard near-prime rates.\nCustomer:So you can't give me any indication at all? What about the default being so recent?\nAgent:Like I said, key it in. The system will tell you. We can't manually assess every adverse scenario over the phone, it's not efficient. Did you check our criteria guide on the portal? It's all there.\nCustomer:I did, but it's a bit vague on combined issues. I was hoping for a bit more clarity before spending time on a DIP.\nAgent:The portal and the DIP outcome are your best bet.

How can I help you today?\nCustomer:I'm a new broker looking to register with Atom Bank. I submitted my initial details online yesterday but haven't heard anything back yet. I was wondering about the typical timeframe and if there's anything else I need to do.\nAgent:Okay, [PERSON_NAME]. So you completed the online registration form? And you received an automated email acknowledging that?\nCustomer:Yes, I did the form, but I don't recall seeing an automated email. Let me quickly check my junk folder... Ah, yes, I see it here. My apologies, I missed that.\nAgent:Oh, no worries at all, [PERSON_NAME]! It happens. That email usually confirms receipt and mentions that our admin team will process it. Typically, they'll reach out within [NUMBER] working days if they need any further clarification or to schedule a welcome call with your BDM. Since you submitted it yesterday, I'd expect you'll hear something by tomorrow or the day after.\nCustomer:Okay, that's helpful. So the welcome call, what does that usually involve?\nAgent:It's just an informal chat with your dedicated BDM. They'll introduce themselves, talk a bit about how we work, our key products, and answer any initial questions you might have. It's also a chance for us to understand your business a bit better. It doesn't take too long.\nCustomer:That sounds good. So, just to confirm, I should wait for the admin team or the BDM to contact me based on that email?\nAgent:That's correct. Once the admin team has done their initial checks, they'll pass your details to the relevant BDM for your area, who will then get in touch to arrange that call.

Can I have your name and the firm you're with?\nCustomer:Morning [PERSON_NAME]. It's [PERSON_NAME] from [BROKER_FIRM_NAME] Partners.\nAgent:Hi [PERSON_NAME]. What can I do for you?\nCustomer:I have a client who is self-employed, a sole trader for [NUMBER] years. Their income dipped a bit in the last financial year due to taking some extended time off. The year before was very strong. How would you view this for affordability?\nAgent:Mmhmm. Self-employed. So, we'd typically look at the last [NUMBER] years' figures. A dip in income, you say? Was it significant?\nCustomer:Profit went from about [NUMBER]k down to [NUMBER]k, but the year before that was [NUMBER]k. So the average over [NUMBER] is still decent, but the most recent is lower.\nAgent:Right. Well, our standard policy is to average the last [NUMBER] years, or take the most recent if lower. So, that lower figure would likely be used. What did they take time off for?\nCustomer:It was for personal reasons, not business-related. They're back working full-time now and current year projections are back up.\nAgent:Okay. We might be able to consider an underwriter's discretion if there's a very strong rationale and evidence of current trading, but it's not guaranteed. The standard approach would be the lower of the latest year or the average. It would be best to submit the DIP with all the figures and a detailed explanation in the notes.\nCustomer:So, no clear 'yes' or 'no' then? It's a bit up in the air?\nAgent:Well, every self-employed case has its nuances. The underwriters need to see the full picture. The system might refer it based on the income pattern you described. You'll know more once the DIP is submitted.\nCustomer:Okay. I was hoping for a bit more certainty. Is there any specific documentation for the 'strong rationale' you mentioned?\nAgent:Just a clear, concise explanation from the applicant, and maybe a letter from their accountant confirming current performance if available. But again, the DIP is the first step.\nCustomer:Alright. I suppose I'll try that. Thanks.\nAgent:You're welcome. Let us know if anything else comes up.\nCustomer:Will do. Bye.\nAgent:Goodbye.",

May I have your name and company, please?\nCustomer:Hi [PERSON_NAME], it's [PERSON_NAME] from [BROKER_FIRM_NAME] Associates. I'm calling about an existing case, reference [CASE_NUMBER].\nAgent:Okay [PERSON_NAME], let me just pull up case [CASE_NUMBER]. One moment... Okay, I have it here. What's the query?\nCustomer:The valuation report came in, but it's slightly lower than the purchase price. The client is happy to make up the difference, but I wanted to confirm if this affects the product chosen, as the LTV will shift slightly, from say [NUMBER]% to [NUMBER]%.\nAgent:Right, I see the valuation figure here. So the Loan to Value has indeed increased a little. Let me check the product terms for you. The product code was [PRODUCT_CODE_EXAMPLE], correct?\nCustomer:Yes, that's the one.\nAgent:Okay, that product had a maximum LTV of [NUMBER]%. Your new LTV of [NUMBER]% is still within that band. So, from a product perspective, it's still valid. We'll just need to ensure the affordability still works with the slightly higher effective LTV against the loan amount requested. Sometimes, our system runs what we call a 'stress test' again if the LTV changes significantly, but for a small change like this, it should be fine as long as the loan amount itself isn't increasing.\nCustomer:Okay, so a 'stress test' is just an affordability re-check?\nAgent:Exactly. It's an internal check to ensure the mortgage remains affordable under various scenarios, especially if key metrics like LTV change. But as I said, with this minor adjustment and no change to the loan amount, it should proceed smoothly. We will issue a revised offer reflecting the new purchase price and LTV figures shortly, assuming all other conditions are met.\nCustomer:That's great news. So, I just need to inform the client they can proceed and await the revised offer?\nAgent:Precisely. The revised offer should be with you within [NUMBER] working hours. It will clearly state the loan amount against the confirmed valuation and purchase price.\nCustomer:Fantastic. Thanks for explaining that so clearly, [PERSON_NAME].\nAgent:You're most welcome, [PERSON_NAME]. Happy to help! Is there anything else on this case or another I can assist with?\nCustomer:No, that's everything for now. Thank you.\nAgent:Alright. Have a good day!\nCustomer:You too. Bye.",

Could I take your name and company details, please?\nCustomer:Hi, it's [PERSON_NAME] from [BROKER_FIRM_NAME] Direct.\nAgent:Hello [PERSON_NAME]. How may I help you today?\nCustomer:I'm looking at your criteria for contractors. My client is on a day rate, [NUMBER] pounds per day. They've been contracting for [NUMBER] months with their current agency, [NUMBER] months remaining on the contract. Before that, they had a [NUMBER]-month contract with a different company. Is this something you can consider?\nAgent:Okay, contractors. We do have a specific policy. We typically require at least [NUMBER] months continuous contracting history, and preferably [NUMBER] months remaining on the current contract, or evidence of likely renewal. What's the total contracting history?\nCustomer:So, [NUMBER] months current, plus [NUMBER] months prior, that's [NUMBER] months total. So the history is there. But only [NUMBER] months remaining on this one.\nAgent:The [NUMBER] months remaining is a bit short of our ideal [NUMBER] months. Do they have any indication of renewal, perhaps an email from the agency or client?\nCustomer:They said it's highly likely to be renewed, but nothing in writing yet. The agency verbally confirmed it's standard for their role.\nAgent:Hmm. Verbally isn't ideal. We prefer written confirmation. We might also look at the 'gaps' between contracts. Were there any significant breaks?\nCustomer:No, less than [NUMBER] weeks between the last one and this one.\nAgent:Okay, that's good. In terms of income calculation, we'd usually take the day rate, multiply by [NUMBER] days, then by, say, [NUMBER] weeks to get an annualised figure. For your client, that's [NUMBER] times [NUMBER] times [NUMBER]... which would be [CALCULATED_INCOME_FIGURE]. We'd need to see the contracts and corresponding bank statements showing the income. Given the shorter remaining term, it might be referred for an underwriter to review. It's not a definite no, but not a guaranteed yes either.\nCustomer:Okay, so it's borderline on the remaining contract term. If I submit a DIP, should I include a note about the high likelihood of renewal?\nAgent:Yes, definitely. Any supporting information you can provide would be beneficial. The underwriter will take a holistic view. There's a chance, but I can't promise anything at this stage.\nCustomer:Understood. That's more helpful. Thanks, [PERSON_NAME].\nAgent:You're welcome, [PERSON_NAME]. Is there anything further?\nCustomer:No, that covers it for now.\nAgent:Okay. Good luck with the application.\nCustomer:Thanks. Bye.",

If you would like to speak to one of our telephone business development managers regarding a new case inquiry, please press one.\nAgent:Thanks for calling Atom Bank, you're speaking with [PERSON_NAME]. Name and firm, please?\nCustomer:Hi [PERSON_NAME], it's [PERSON_NAME] from [BROKER_FIRM_NAME] Advisory. I've got a slightly tricky one. My client is looking to purchase a new build property, but the completion date isn't for another [NUMBER] months. Your offers are typically valid for [NUMBER] months, right?\nAgent:That's correct, [PERSON_NAME]. Our standard mortgage offers are valid for [NUMBER] months. For new build properties, we can sometimes offer an extension, usually up to a maximum of [NUMBER] or [NUMBER] months from the initial offer, subject to criteria.\nCustomer:Okay, so an extension might be possible. But this one is [NUMBER] months out. The developer is quite reputable, but they won't commit to an earlier date.\nAgent:Hmm, [NUMBER] months is quite a way out, even for a new build. We'd typically need the completion to be within that [NUMBER] to [NUMBER]-month extended window. What often happens is brokers will apply closer to the time, say when there's about [NUMBER] to [NUMBER] months left until anticipated completion. This avoids the offer expiring too early.\nCustomer:Right, I understand that, but the client is very keen to get an offer secured now for peace of mind. They're worried about rate changes. You see, they're also selling their current property and want to tie everything up. If they apply now, and the offer expires before completion...\nAgent:I see the dilemma. If they apply now, and the offer expires, they would indeed need to reapply. This would involve a new credit check, affordability assessment, and potentially a new valuation. The product they initially chose might also no longer be available, and they'd have to pick from the prevailing range at the time of re-application. So, there's that risk.\nCustomer:So, it's a bit of a gamble then. Is there any flexibility at all for completions beyond [NUMBER] months, even with a developer like [DEVELOPER_NAME]?\nAgent:Unfortunately, our policy is fairly firm on the maximum offer validity, even with extensions. For a [NUMBER]-month completion, it's highly unlikely we could issue an offer now that would remain valid. My best advice, to ensure a valid offer at completion, would be to delay the application until you're within that [NUMBER] to [NUMBER]-month window of the expected completion date.\nCustomer:Okay, I suspected that might be the case. So, when you say 'delay the application', you mean the full application. Can I do a DIP now to check affordability and credit, and then convert to a full application later?\nAgent:Yes, you could submit a Decision in Principle now. A DIP is usually valid for [NUMBER] days, and it would give you and your client an indication of our willingness to lend, subject to full underwriting and valuation. It doesn't secure the rate, though. The rate is only secured upon full mortgage application submission. So, if rates change between the DIP and the full application, the new rates would apply.\nCustomer:Ah, okay. So the DIP gives an idea of creditworthiness but not the rate for that long. That's useful to know. Thanks, [PERSON_NAME], you've explained the options clearly.\nAgent:You're welcome, [PERSON_NAME]. It's a common query with new builds. Glad I could clarify our position. Is there anything else I can help with?\nCustomer:No, I think that covers it. I'll relay this to my client.\nAgent:Alright. Best of luck with it.\nCustomer:Thank you. Bye.",

It's [PERSON_NAME] from [BROKER_FIRM_NAME]. I'm calling about a declined DIP, reference [DIP_NUMBER]. I don't understand the reason.\nAgent:Okay, [DIP_NUMBER]. (typing) Right, it says 'Credit Score - Policy Fail'.\nCustomer:Yes, I see that. But what does it mean? The client has a good credit score with Experian, over [NUMBER]. They have one old default from [NUMBER] years ago that's satisfied.\nAgent:Our internal credit scoring model is proprietary. It considers multiple data points beyond just the headline score from one CRA. It's an automated decision based on our risk appetite. The system looks at the overall credit profile, including credit utilization, recency of adverse, type of credit, stability factors...\nCustomer:But can you tell me *what specific factor* caused the decline? Was it the old default? Or something else? I need to explain it to my client.\nAgent:I can't give you the specific weighting of each factor. It's a cumulative assessment. The 'Policy Fail' indicates that one or more aspects of the credit profile did not meet our minimum lending criteria as defined within the scorecard logic. It could be a combination of things. We don't get a breakdown of the individual components that lead to the score fail, just the outcome.\nCustomer:So you're saying you can't tell me why it was declined, other than 'computer says no'? That's not very helpful. How can I advise my client if I don't know the issue?\nAgent:The system makes the decision based on the data provided and our pre-set parameters. The decline reason is 'Credit Score - Policy Fail'. That's the information I have. We don't manually underwrite DIPs that fail the automated score.\nCustomer:This is ridiculous. So there's no appeal? No way to understand what to fix?\nAgent:Appeals are generally for when incorrect information was submitted. If all information was correct, the decision stands. The client may wish to review their full credit reports from all major CRAs to ensure accuracy and identify any potential areas for improvement for future applications with other lenders.\nCustomer:Unbelievable. So, Atom Bank just declines people with opaque jargon and offers no transparency. Great. Thanks for nothing.\nAgent:I've provided the reason given by the system.

If you would like to speak to one of our telephone business development managers regarding a new case inquiry, please press one.\nAgent:Thank you for calling Atom Bank. This is [PERSON_NAME]. Can I start with your name and the company you're calling from?\nCustomer:Hi [PERSON_NAME], my name is [PERSON_NAME], and I'm with [BROKER_FIRM_NAME] Finance.\nAgent:Hello [PERSON_NAME]. How can I assist you today?\nCustomer:I'm looking at your product range, specifically the [NUMBER]-year fixed rate for remortgages. It states there's a free standard valuation. My client's property is a bit unusual – it's a Grade [NUMBER] listed building. Would that still qualify for the free standard valuation?\nAgent:That's a good question. For our free standard valuation offer, it typically covers straightforward properties. For something like a Grade [NUMBER] listed building, it often requires a more specialist valuation due to the complexities involved. Let me just double-check our policy on that... one moment. (typing sounds)\nCustomer:Okay, thank you.\nAgent:Right, I've checked. Actually, I initially thought it might require a fee, but our current terms for that specific product do state that the free valuation applies unless it's significantly complex or over a certain value threshold, which your client's property isn't. So, yes, it should still be covered.\nCustomer:Oh, are you sure? I was told by another lender that listed buildings always incur a specialist fee.\nAgent:My apologies, I might have misspoken slightly in my initial thought process. Let me be very precise. (re-checks notes) Yes, I'm looking at the specific product factsheet you mentioned, and for properties up to [PROPERTY_VALUE_THRESHOLD], a standard valuation is included, and it doesn't explicitly exclude Grade [NUMBER] listed, provided it's a residential dwelling. So, based on this, it should be fine.\nCustomer:Oh, okay. So my initial interpretation that it would be included was correct then?\nAgent:Yes, it appears so. I do apologize if my initial hesitation caused any confusion. I was thinking of some of our more complex bespoke products. But for this standard remortgage product, it seems the free valuation offer is more inclusive for listed properties of standard construction type than I first recalled. So, yes, you should be good to proceed on that basis.\nCustomer:That's great news! Thank you for double-checking and clarifying, [PERSON_NAME]. I appreciate your honesty.\nAgent:Not a problem at all, [PERSON_NAME]. It's important to get these details right. Glad I could confirm it for you. Will there be anything else?\nCustomer:No, that was the main thing. Thanks again!\nAgent:You're very welcome. Have a good day.\nCustomer:You too. Bye.",

If you would like to speak to one of our telephone business development managers regarding a new case inquiry, please press one.\nAgent:Atom Bank, [PERSON_NAME]. Your name and company?\nCustomer:Hi, it's [PERSON_NAME] from [BROKER_FIRM_NAME] Group. I have a few questions about your application process. It's my first time submitting to you.\nAgent:Okay, go ahead. But try to be quick, I've got other calls waiting.\nCustomer:Right. Firstly, when I upload documents to the portal, what's the typical turnaround time for them to be reviewed?\nAgent:Depends on volume. Usually [NUMBER] to [NUMBER] working days. It's all in the SLA on the portal.\nCustomer:Okay. And if there's an issue with a document, say, a bank statement is missing a page, will I be notified promptly, or will the case just stall?\nAgent:You should get an email. Or the case tracker will update. You need to keep an eye on the portal. We expect brokers to manage their submissions. Next question?\nCustomer:Alright. Regarding valuations, do you instruct them automatically on submission, or is there a separate fee payment stage first for purchases?\nAgent:For purchases, the valuation fee needs to be paid before instruction. For remos with free vals, it's automatic. This is standard stuff.\nCustomer:Okay, I understand that. I just wanted to confirm your specific process. And finally, if the underwriter has a query, do they call the broker directly, or does it come via a generic email?\nAgent:Usually an email to the registered address for the case. Sometimes a BDM might call if it's complex. Look, most of this is covered in our 'How to Business With Us' guide on the website. Have you read that?\nCustomer:I've skimmed it, but I find it quicker to ask directly sometimes for clarity.\nAgent:Well, the guides are there for a reason. It saves us time on these basic process questions. Anything else critical?\nCustomer:No, I think that covers the main points for now. Thank you for your time.\nAgent:Right. Make sure to check the portal regularly for updates on your cases. Bye.\nCustomer:Okay, will do. Bye.",

If you would like to speak to one of our telephone business development managers regarding a new case inquiry, please press one.\nYou are the next caller in the queue.\nAgent:Good morning! Thank you for calling Atom Bank, you're speaking with [PERSON_NAME], one of our Telephone BDMs. So I can bring up your details, could I please take your name and the name of your brokerage?\nCustomer:Good morning, [PERSON_NAME]. My name is [PERSON_NAME], and I'm a new broker at [BROKER_FIRM_NAME] Solutions. This is my first time thinking about placing a case with Atom Bank.\nAgent:A very warm welcome to you, [PERSON_NAME], and to [BROKER_FIRM_NAME] Solutions! We're delighted you're considering us. How can I help you get started or answer any initial questions for you today?\nCustomer:Thank you, that's a nice welcome! I'm just trying to understand the overall process. For example, if I have a client who fits your general criteria, what's the very first step? Is it a DIP, or do I need to register first?\nAgent:That's an excellent question, [PERSON_NAME]. The very first step, if you haven't already, is to get yourself registered as an intermediary with us. Have you done that yet, or would you like me to guide you on how to do that?\nCustomer:I haven't registered yet, no. I wanted to understand the flow before I dived in.\nAgent:Perfectly sensible! So, registration is straightforward. You'd go to our intermediary website – I can give you the direct link if you need it – and there's a 'Register' button. You'll fill in some details about yourself and your firm. Once that's submitted, our admin team does a quick review, and then your dedicated BDM for your region will reach out to you for a welcome call. Does that make sense so far?\nCustomer:Yes, that's clear. So, website, register, then a welcome call. After the welcome call, am I then able to submit cases?\nAgent:Exactly! Once you're fully registered and had that welcome chat, you'll have access to our broker portal. Through the portal, you can then submit a Decision in Principle, or a DIP as we often call it. This will give you an initial indication of whether we're likely to lend to your client based on their circumstances and our credit policy. It also checks their credit file.\nCustomer:Okay, so registration, then DIP via the portal. What sort of information do I need for the DIP typically?\nAgent:For the DIP, you'll need your client's personal details, income information, details of their existing credit commitments, and information about the property they're looking to mortgage and the loan amount. It's fairly standard. The portal guides you through each section. Do you feel comfortable with that part?\nCustomer:Yes, that sounds like the usual information. And if the DIP is accepted, then it's onto a full application, I presume?\nAgent:You've got it, [PERSON_NAME]! If the DIP is accepted, you can then proceed to a full mortgage application, again via the portal. That's when you'll upload all the supporting documents, like payslips, bank statements, ID, and so on. We have checklists available to help you know exactly what's needed.\nCustomer:This is really helpful, [PERSON_NAME]. You've made it sound very straightforward. I was a bit daunted, but that step-by-step explanation is great.\nAgent:I'm so glad to hear that, [PERSON_NAME]! Our aim is to make it as easy as possible for our broker partners. We're here to support you. Once you're registered, you'll also have the direct contact details for your field-based BDM and your telephone BDM team, like myself, for any ongoing queries.\nCustomer:Fantastic. I'll get onto the registration today then. Thank you so much for your time and patience.\nAgent:It's been my absolute pleasure, [PERSON_NAME]. We really look forward to working with you. If any other questions pop up as you go through the registration or your first DIP, please don't hesitate to call us back. We're here to help!\nCustomer:I will do. Thanks again, [PERSON_NAME]. Have a wonderful day!\nAgent:You too, [PERSON_NAME]! And welcome aboard, soon! Take care.\nCustomer:Thanks! Bye.",

Your name?\nCustomer:Hello, my name is [PERSON_NAME]. I'm having a really difficult time with my online banking portal. I'm trying to initiate a CHAPS payment for a property completion, but the system keeps flagging it for 'insufficient transactional velocity metrics' and I have no idea what that means.\nAgent:Right. So you're saying the payment isn't going through. Have you tried clearing your cache and cookies? Or using a different browser? Sometimes the DOM doesn't render correctly.\nCustomer:I... I don't think that's the issue. It's a specific error message about 'transactional velocity metrics'. I need this payment to go through today, it's very urgent. It's for [CURRENCY_AMOUNT] [CURRENCY_UNIT].\nAgent:Uh-huh. The T.V.M. error usually relates to our backend risk assessment algorithms. It's based on a multi-factor authentication of your typical transactional profile. Did you receive an OTP to your registered device?\nCustomer:A what? An OTP? I got a text message with a code, yes, and I entered it. But then I got this error. What do I need to do? Can you just... push it through from your end?\nAgent:Well, I can't directly interface with the payment gateway's risk engine. You might need to de-register and re-register your multi-factor authentication protocol. Or, it could be an issue with the beneficiary's sort code not aligning with our Faster Payments scheme parameters, even for CHAPS. Let me check the internal knowledge base for T.V.M. error code [ERROR_CODE]. One moment.\nCustomer:This is really complicated. I just need to make a payment. Is there someone else I can speak to?\nAgent:All agents are currently trained on these protocols. Let me see... ah, it says here if the T.V.M. flag persists after [NUMBER] attempts, you may need to visit a branch with [NUMBER] forms of ID for manual override, subject to AML checks. Or you could try sending a smaller amount first to recalibrate the velocity parameters.\nCustomer:Visit a branch? I don't have time for that! And sending a smaller amount won't work for a house completion! This is incredibly unhelpful.\nAgent:I'm just relaying the information from the system, sir. Perhaps try the payment again in an hour after the batch processing cycle completes.\nCustomer:Unbelievable. Okay, I guess I have no choice. Thanks for nothing.\nAgent:You're welcome. Call back if the issue persists beyond the next cycle. Bye.",

The person I spoke to specifically said there would be no additional charges.\nAgent:Hmm, I see. Our standard terms do indicate that correspondent bank fees can sometimes apply. Let me check the notes from your previous call... Oh, I seem to have clicked the wrong thing, sorry about that, one moment. My apologies, [CUSTOMER_NAME], I was looking at the wrong screen. Yes, I see the note here. It does say that all *our* fees were included. The '[FEE_DESCRIPTION]' is often a charge from the receiving bank, which is outside our control.\nCustomer:So, you're saying it's not your fee? That wasn't made clear at all.\nAgent:I understand your frustration, [CUSTOMER_NAME]. While we can't waive fees charged by other institutions, I can certainly log your feedback about the clarity of information provided. For future transfers, we can advise on methods that might minimize such third-party charges. Would you like me to do that?\nCustomer:Yes, please log the feedback.

How may I assist you today, [PERSON_NAME]?\nCustomer:Hi [AGENT_NAME], my name is [CUSTOMER_NAME]. I'm trying to understand your 'Capital Accumulator Mortgage' product. I'm a first-time buyer, and it sounds interesting, but the brochure is a bit dense.\nAgent:Certainly, [CUSTOMER_NAME]. The Capital Accumulator is a hybrid interest-only product with an embedded derivative option linked to the FTSE [NUMBER] index. Essentially, your monthly repayments cover the interest, and a portion is hypothecated towards a structured product designed for capital appreciation, leveraging a collar strategy to mitigate downside risk while capping upside potential. Are you familiar with call and put options?\nCustomer:Um, not really. Hypothecated? Derivative? Collar strategy? That sounds very complicated. I just want to know if it will help me pay off my mortgage faster.\nAgent:Well, the capital growth is contingent on market performance, of course. The product's ISIN is [ISIN_CODE], and its KiiD document details the specific risk factors, including counterparty risk with the derivative issuer and the potential for underperformance if the index remains static or declines. The LTV is also capped at [PERCENTAGE]% due to the product's risk profile.\nCustomer:KiiD? LTV? I'm sorry, [AGENT_NAME], I'm more confused now than when I started. Is there a simpler way to explain if this is a good idea for someone like me?\nAgent:The suitability would depend on your risk appetite and investment horizon. The product is generally aimed at individuals with a sophisticated understanding of market-linked investments and a capacity for loss, should the derivative component fail to perform. We generally advise a consultation with an independent financial advisor to assess the appropriateness of non-vanilla mortgage products.\nCustomer:So... you can't just tell me if it's a good or bad mortgage for a first-time buyer?\nAgent:It's not a matter of 'good' or 'bad', [CUSTOMER_NAME]. It's about aligning the product's characteristics with your financial objectives and risk tolerance. The KiiD clearly outlines the stochastic modelling used for performance projections.\nCustomer:Okay. I think I need to do a lot more reading. Or maybe look at a different product. Thanks anyway.\nAgent:You're welcome. We have standard repayment mortgages available as well. Feel free to call back. Bye.\nCustomer:Bye.",

How can I help you, [PERSON_NAME]?\nCustomer:Hi [PERSON_NAME], it's [CUSTOMER_NAME]. I received a letter yesterday about changes to my overdraft facility, and I'm really confused. It mentions something about a 'risk-based repricing initiative' and 'adjusted EAR'.\nAgent:Right, [CUSTOMER_NAME]. That would be the standard notification regarding our dynamic overdraft pricing model. All customers are being migrated to the new tariff structure based on their credit profile and account conduct. The EAR is simply the Equivalent Annual Rate, adjusted for the new risk algorithm.\nCustomer:But the letter says my overdraft limit is being reduced by [PERCENTAGE]% and the interest rate is going up! I don't understand why. I've always managed my account well.\nAgent:Well, 'well' is subjective, isn't it? The system algorithmically assesses multiple data points, including your credit utilization ratio across all products, not just our overdraft. If your overall indebtedness profile has shifted, or if the general market risk parameters have been recalibrated by our central credit risk department, then the EAR and available facility will be adjusted accordingly. Did you not read the pre-notification letter sent [NUMBER] weeks ago outlining the potential for these changes?\nCustomer:I don't recall getting a pre-notification letter! And what does 'indebtedness profile' mean? I just use my overdraft occasionally for small amounts. This feels very unfair. I rely on that overdraft limit.\nAgent:The terms and conditions, [CUSTOMER_NAME], which you agreed to, state that the overdraft is repayable on demand and subject to periodic review and alteration. The risk-based repricing is fully compliant with FCA guidelines. It's not a personal decision; it's a systemic recalibration. You can see the full tariff schedule on our website under 'Current Account Charges'.\nCustomer:But I want to understand *my* specific situation. Why *my* limit is being cut. Can you look at my account and tell me?\nAgent:I can tell you that the system has determined your new limit and EAR based on the proprietary risk model. I don't have access to the specific weighting of each data point in that algorithm. It's an automated decision. If you wish to formally dispute the change, you'll need to submit a written complaint to our [DEPARTMENT_NAME] department, outlining your reasons. The address is on the letter.\nCustomer:So you can't actually help me understand it or do anything about it now?\nAgent:I've explained the basis for the change, [CUSTOMER_NAME]. The process for disputing it is via a written submission. That's the procedure.\nCustomer:This is ridiculous. I'm going to have to look at banking elsewhere.\nAgent:That is, of course, your prerogative. Is there anything else I can clarify regarding the notification letter?\nCustomer:No. Clearly not.

How can I help you today, [PERSON_NAME]?\nCustomer:Hi [AGENT_NAME], it's [CUSTOMER_NAME]. I'm looking at your personal loan options, and I'm a bit confused about the eligibility criteria, specifically regarding employment.\nAgent:Hello [CUSTOMER_NAME], I can certainly help clarify that for you. What's your specific question about employment?\nCustomer:Well, I've recently started a new job. I've only been there for [NUMBER] months. Would I still be eligible to apply, or do you require a longer period of continuous employment?\nAgent:That's a great question. For our standard personal loans, we generally look for applicants to be in permanent, paid employment and past any probationary period. Typically, that means at least [NUMBER] to [NUMBER] months with the current employer. Oh, actually, apologies, [CUSTOMER_NAME], I misspoke slightly there. For applicants who have been with their current employer for less than [NUMBER] months, we can still consider the application, but we would also require evidence of continuous employment for the previous [NUMBER] months in a similar role or industry. So, if you've been in your new job for [NUMBER] months, as long as you were employed before that without a significant gap, you could still be eligible.\nCustomer:Oh, that's good to know! Yes, I was with my previous employer for [NUMBER] years in a very similar role before I moved to this new one. There was no gap.\nAgent:Excellent! In that case, your recent job change shouldn't be an issue. We would just ask for your most recent payslips from your new employer and perhaps your P60 or final payslip from your previous employer to show that continuous employment history.\nCustomer:That makes sense. And what about income levels? Is there a minimum income required?\nAgent:Yes, there is a minimum gross annual income requirement of [CURRENCY_AMOUNT] [CURRENCY_UNIT]. And of course, all applications are subject to a credit check and affordability assessment.\nCustomer:Okay, that's very clear. Thank you so much, [AGENT_NAME].
